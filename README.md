# Stick-Fighter
Joint final project for mobile app design and AI courses
Ben Michael and Tristan Hildahl

The original aim of this project was to create a game of "perfect knowledge" in Unity in which a single player fights a single enemy with the exact same abilities.
The AI enemy was to be trained against a copy of itself using Unity's experimental machine learning extension built on TensorFlow. After the
experimental extension failed, we quickly put together a decision tree-based AI instead so the game would still be functional.
